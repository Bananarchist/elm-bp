# BOILERPLATE
Repo for quickly getting some boilerplate Elm project setup out of the way

## What you have to do
- `elm init`
	- Install any elm dependencies
- `chmod +x scripts/*.sh`
- `rm .git`
- Get coding!


## Assumed dependencies
- Some sort of unix environment (bash) for convenience scripts
- Elm, obviously
- Python 3 (accessable via `python3`) for serving files
